                 I am 21 years old and from the Dominican Republic. A small but beautiful country in the Caribbean. 
                 In this small country at an early age was where my curiosity sparked up. I love to explore, adventures, 
                 and sports but more than anything to create and it has always been this way, from small crafting projects 
                 to coding projects nowadays.
                   <br />
                   <br />
                   My curiosity ended up pushing me to code, after trying different careers such as
                    exercise science and math I somehow ended up landing in computer science, and I am glad I did. 
                    Coding, in general, has been somewhat a scape and a way of projecting my creativity, where anything 
                    and everything could be as I want it to be since I am the one in control.
                   <br />
                   <br />
                   My vision is to make things better/effortless for everyone with the help of code, especially now that 
                   the world has changed so much because of the pandemic. Technology is progressing pretty quickly and it allows
                    for more creativity to emerge and for more to get done. My goal is to end up somewhere where I could be of use and
                     where I am allowed to grow along the way.
